        <h1 class="title"><strong>Rules</strong></h1>
        <h2 class="subtitle">Yes, we <em>do</em> expect you to read these through.</h2>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Discord Terms of Service</strong></p>
          <p>
            You must <strong><em>always</em></strong> follow <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms">Discord’s Terms of Service</a> in Aurora.
            If you are found to violate the Discord Terms of Service, we have the right to penalize you within our server alongside contacting Discord about your violation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Content Not Allowed in Chat</strong></p>
          <p>
            Spam of all types is strictly prohibited in Aurora.
            If you spam, you will be automatically placed into the <strong>Muted</strong> role, with which you can no longer send messages except in the <em>#muted</em> channel.
            <br/>There’s several types of content that you are not allowed to post in Aurora.
            These include, but are not limited to:
            <br/>- NSFW imagery (pornography, hentai, CP, etc.)
            <br/>- copy-pastas (“copy this everywhere or else haCkerS!!!1”)
            <br/>- threats (DDoS threats, death threats, etc.)
            <br/>- files containing malware (also against both the Discord Terms of Service and the law!)
            <br/>- things like TeamViewer credentials, join.me links, game links, etc. without permission from an Administrator or above
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Arguments &amp; Drama</strong></p>
          <p>We try to keep Aurora a nice place for everyone to hang out and chat.
            This includes drama and arguments.
            If you’re having an argument with somebody that’s not something being publicly debated in <em>#mainchat</em>, please take that argument to DMs.
            We want to keep the Aurora chat free of unnecessary drama and fighting.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Harassment of Other Members</strong></p>
          <p>We don’t take harassment lightly.
            You will receive a strike if another member reports feeling harassed by you <strong>with decent reason to feel harassed</strong>.
            Do not make hasty accusations or assumptions about other members.
            If we unban somebody, it’s more than likely due to an appeal, a false ban, or to give somebody a second chance.
            Please treat everyone fairly until they act up.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>User-Botting/Self-Botting</strong></p>
          <p>Using a bot on your user account to create or edit messages on Aurora is strictly prohibited.
            If it appears you’re user-botting, you’ll receive a strike unless you can prove otherwise.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Language and Humor</strong></p>
          <p>
            We’re extremely lenient when it comes to language and humor in Aurora. However, we do have a few restrictions.
            You may say anything you want in Aurora (that doesn’t violate any other rules, of course) except the following:
            <br/>- racial slurs <strong>said in a racist/demeaning context</strong>
            <br/>- terms used directly towards other another member harmfully
            <br/>- anything used to belittle others (that doesn’t seem to be in a humorous context)
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Your Profile</strong></p>
          <p>
            On Aurora, we completely agree with freedom of speech and expression.
            However, we have a few restrictions when it comes to your profile.
            Here’s a few guidelines to keep in mind regarding your profile:
            <br/>- Your nickname <strong>must</strong> begin with an A–Z, 0–9 character.
            <br/>- Your username and nickname are expected to be appropriate in the same way as chat content.
            <br/>- Your profile picture must either be an image or the default Discord profile image.
            Blank profile images, NSFW images, or any other content that would be disallowed in chats is also strictly prohibited from being in your profile picture.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Staff Decisions</strong></p>
          <p>We place a large deal of trust in our staff members to keep Aurora a safe, clean environment.
            We have a few expectations of our members regarding staff and the decisions they make.
            We expect that staff will make fair decisions when issuing punishments (strikes, kicks and bans).
            If a staff member feels you’re acting against expectations for something that isn’t specified within the rules, the staff member has the right to issue a punishment.
            If you feel you were punished wrongly, you can submit an appeal at <a href="https://auroracommunity.co/appeal">https://auroracommunity.co/appeal</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Utilities and Role Tags</strong></p>
          <p>
            We provide the <em>@Staff</em> role mention as a means for you to contact the staff during a situation in which there is an issue which needs immediate fixing.
            Please do not misuse this or similar services and tools we provide for you in Aurora.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
          <p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>
          <p>Exceptions to these rules may be granted to you on a specific case-by-case basis.
            However, one restriction applies: these exceptions may only be granted by Managers or higher, unless otherwise stated in the rule.</p>
